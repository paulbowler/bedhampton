						<p>Bedhampton Pianoshop was established in 1988, and we have been buying, selling and restoring pianos ever since. We always have a selection of <g:link action="pianosForSale">pianos for sale</g:link>. Our aim is to stock a range of restored <g:link action="restoredPianos">upright pianos</g:link>, <g:link action="grandPianos">grand pianos</g:link> and <g:link action="modernPianos">modern pianos</g:link>, with something to accommodate all requirements, tastes and budgets.</p>
						<p>Our second hand stock is professionally reconditioned, with the benefit of over 20 yearsâ€™ experience in all aspects of restoration, and an extensive network of expert technicians. We can also carry out work on your own piano, and will undertake anything from a small repair to a complete rebuild. We cover large parts of Hampshire, West Sussex, Surrey and Dorset, but also serve customers from further afield, and pianos can be delivered nationwide.</p>
						<p>We have the ability to carry out almost any aspect of restoration, however large or small, and we are able to do most jobs in-house, keeping costs low. Our most common restoration procedures include action reconditioning and repairs, regulation, restringing, cleaning or repolishing of casework and cleaning or re-covering of keys. Please visit our <g:link action="restoration">piano restoration</g:link> or <g:link action="video">video</g:link> pages for further details and examples of our work.</p>
